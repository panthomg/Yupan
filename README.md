> **The Story Behind Yupan:**  
> The original concept for Yupan was dreamed up by my friend **Yuta**, and I (**@itzpanth** / **TinTools Solutions**) took that vision, engineered it, and brought it into complete reality. Together, we wanted to break free from linear note-taking and build something that matches how the brain naturally thinks.

Whether you're working solo or collaborating with a team, Yupan syncs your thoughts to the cloud in real-time.
